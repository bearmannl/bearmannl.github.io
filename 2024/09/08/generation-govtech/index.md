# Generation GovTech


# Generation GovTech

## Introduction
This post introduces a new term, Generation GovTech, or GenGT for short.

You'll find a full description of this term below. To explain it fully, we'll first cover the recruitment campaign by the Dutch Ministry of Defense: [Generation D](https://werkenbijdefensie.nl/generatie-d)

### Generation D
In 2022, the MoD launched the [recruitment campaign Generation D](https://www.defensie.nl/actueel/nieuws/2022/04/20/wervingscampagne-richt-zich-op-generatie-d). The campaign aimed to attract people with a specific mindset. This mindset includes individuals who want to do meaningful work, believe in cooperation, and seek personal growth.

The campaign's core principle is admirable. In 2023, it [won the Effie award](https://www.defensie.nl/actueel/nieuws/2023/11/17/defensie-wint-effie-award-met-arbeidsmarktcampagne-generatie-d) for its strong message of a shared mindset. The numbers showed a 71% increase in web traffic and a 30% rise in job applications.

The campaign is worth examining due to its strong message, regardless of the Defense department context. It unifies people with a common goal. The impressive numbers highlight why the concept is compelling.

Initially aimed at young adults, the campaign has become a mindset not tied to age. It inspires anyone to work towards a common goal. This serves as a jumping-off point for Generation GovTech.

### GovTech
GovTech describes technological initiatives and innovations within the government sector. Unlike Generation D, it wasn't conceived as a mindset. However, it embodies core principles such as:
- **Citizen-Centric Technology Solutions**: Delivering technology solutions that improve citizens' experiences and needs.
- **Innovation in Public Services**: Embracing digital transformation to enhance public services.
- **Tech-Savvy Mindset**: Attracting public service professionals to a community of tech-savvy peers.

GovTech gained traction around 2016, [overtaking the term Civic Tech](https://www.govocal.com/blog/whats-difference-civic-tech-govtech). This shift is linked to the rebranding of the [Government Technology Agency in Singapore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_Technology_Agency).

In the Netherlands, [GovTech NL was launched in 2018](https://govtechglobal.org/govtech-nl) by the Dutch Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations. It is now part of the [GovTech Global Alliance](https://govtechglobal.org/aboutus), which rebranded from The Civtech Alliance.

In 2021, the City of The Hague and the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations [published a report](https://www.government.nl/documents/reports/2021/06/30/govtech-in-the-netherlands) on GovTech in the Netherlands. The report shows how the Netherlands fosters partnerships between innovators and public authorities, a trend named 'GovTech.'

To achieve better partnerships between innovators and public authorities, we need cultural change. While organizations need to change, it is the people who make this happen.

### Ecosystems & Mindset
To wrap up this introduction, people need to adopt a common mindset. Innovators can lead in adopting the GovTech mindset, but the goal is to establish better partnerships between innovators and public authorities.

Instead of adopting this mindset one 'customer & vendor' relationship at a time, we should work towards the entire ecosystem around public authorities. As more ecosystem members adopt the GovTech mindset, we shape a generation where GovTech is the common mindset.

## Adoption of Generation GovTech
Adopting the Generation GovTech mindset has transformative potential. By focusing on citizen-centric public services, creating a transparent ecosystem, and advocating for change, we can unify people around this mindset.

To instigate this change, I propose the following actions as our common roadmap to make GovTech even more successful.

### 1. Vision and Goals
- **Vision**: Generation GovTech stands for innovation, efficiency, transparency, and citizen-centric services in public services.
- **Goals**: Inspire people to adopt this mindset and advocate for it within the public services space.

### 2. Engaging Stakeholders
- **Engage Key Players**: Involve public authorities and technology vendors. Form a coalition of champions passionate about GovTech.

### 3. Culture of Innovation
- **Experiential Learning**: Deliver often, fail safely, and learn by doing. Create safe spaces for innovation.
- **Education and Training**: Provide adequate support at all levels to enable innovation.

### 4. Inspire and Share Success
- **Lead by Example**: Celebrate success and inspire people to unify under the GovTech mindset.

### 5. Work with Iterative Steps
- **Agile Practices**: Demonstrate success in incremental steps. Show iterative success at a rapid pace. Make Generation GovTech part of daily practice.

### 6. Continuous Improvement
- **Regular Reviews**: Regularly review and refine strategies. High-paced innovation requires frequent reviews.

### 7. Build a Community
- **Establish Networks**: Create networks within the ecosystem. Encourage cross-department and cross-sector collaboration. Public authorities and technology vendors should promote innovation and share success stories.

## Conclusion
Generation GovTech represents a transformative mindset for public services. By adopting this mindset, we can create a transparent, innovative, and citizen-centric ecosystem. Engaging stakeholders, fostering a culture of innovation, and working iteratively will drive this change. Continuous improvement and community building are essential to sustain this transformation. Together, we can shape a generation where GovTech is the common mindset, leading to better public services and stronger partnerships between innovators and public authorities.
