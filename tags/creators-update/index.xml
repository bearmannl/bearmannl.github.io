      <description>Since the Creators Update navigating to any Google site (google.com, google.co.uk, google.nl, etc.) results in an INET_E_RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND error, only on my work laptop, none of my other devices which I&amp;rsquo;ve also upgraded.
This only happened with Google, no other site had this issue&amp;hellip; furthermore I could reach Google(.com) fine via Ping from commandline, Internet Explorer, FireFox and Chrome&amp;hellip;
Cleared my (Edge) browser cache, history, etc. no results. Everything was working fine until the Creators Update.</description>

      <description>Last week I upgraded all my personal Windows 10 devices to build 1703 (Creators Update) and after a few days of testing I was convinced this build is solid enough to upgrade my work laptop as well&amp;hellip; true so far except for one minor issue! When I had to connect to a client&amp;rsquo;s RemoteApp and Desktop Connection gateway, which they host on Windows Server 2008R2, I got the following error: &amp;ldquo;Your computer canâ€™t connect to the Remote Desktop Gateway server.</description>
