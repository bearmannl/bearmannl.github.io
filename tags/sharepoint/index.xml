      <description>Ran into an annoying issue today where a SharePoint server was not writing trace log messages, the result was a log directory with 0 bytes logging files. Incidentally I found a Event Log error with the code:Ã‚&amp;nbsp;Session &#34;WSSUSAGESESSION15&#34; failed to start with the following error: 0xC0000022 Other posts mention adding the service account (or the WSS_WPG group) for the &#39;SharePoint Tracing Service&#39; Windows Service to the administrators group, tested that, this indeed fixes the problem.</description>

      <description>The education sector In consultancy we see a wide range of business sectors. From healthcare, to banking, but also the education sector. Yesterday I was providing advice on user adoption and migration strategies for a large educational institute. In attempting to explain the security architecture of Office365 and SharePoint Online I used several metaphors. To summarize what I had told him, my customer offered a metaphor of his own in return which I found to be very effective.</description>
