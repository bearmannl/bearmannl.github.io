      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;firewall-port-testing&#34; class=&#34;headerLink&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#firewall-port-testing&#34; class=&#34;header-mark&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Firewall port testing&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;intro&#34; class=&#34;headerLink&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#intro&#34; class=&#34;header-mark&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently I had some issues at a customer project where, due to the complexity of the environment, sometimes firewall ports were closed after they had initially been added to the rules list. This caused unexpected errors for SharePoint, of which we were unaware at the time that these were due to firewall issues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While analyzing the issue I came across the Test-NetConnection PowerShell command, which I used to manually verify the issue on one server. However when the time came to repeat the command on several servers I started automating things with my own script. Soon enough the project manager asked me if I could output the results of my script to Excel and send him the files by mail.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
