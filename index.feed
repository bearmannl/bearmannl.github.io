Shame on me, Microsoft consultant couldn\u0026rsquo;t figure out a simple IIS redirect rule\u0026hellip; In my defense, I hadn\u0026rsquo;t really taken the time to do it properly and I had in fact solved it, but in the wrong order. To setup an AzureWebsite using a custom domain you need to configure it in several places:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIn the Azure portal;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDNS records with your domain registrar;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIn your application, in my case WordPress;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAn IIS rule to do the actual rewrite/redirect.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"setting-the-configuration\" class=\"headerLink\"\u003e\r\n    \u003ca href=\"#setting-the-configuration\" class=\"header-mark\" aria-label=\"Header mark for 'Setting the configuration'\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003eSetting the configuration\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhere to configure in Azure? In the Azure Portal find your Web App settings and under the Routing header click on Custom Domains and SSL. Select Bring External Domain and follow the instructions. Pay attention to using the correct type of DNS records, A records and CNAME records, depending on the correct entry. With your domain registrar find the DNS Manager to actually enter the records. You need to set the awverify.*.azurewebsites.net record with a CNAME to verify your custom domain with Azure. I went and created an A record for my domain to the AzureWebsite. Most registrars provide a warning stating you need to wait a maximum of up to 24 hours before the records are updated, in my case they were available within a minute, this may vary based on the receiving location however. In your application add your custom domain, in the case of WordPress go to General Settings and edit your WordPress Address (URL) and Site Address (URL) accordingly. Finally comes the last bit of magic, the IIS rewrite rule.

While implementing this I made one of those silly mistakes that cause you to spend hours looking for a solution… which is in fact one simple undocumented configuration setting. For our SfB configuration we use a high availability SQL cluster and we’ve also set up a Database Availability Group, or DAG. Once enabled, the first field gets relabeled ‘SQL Server Availability Group Listener FQDN’, the second ‘SQL Server FQDN’. Initially before enabling the DAG I set these values:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eField 1, SQL Server DAG FQDN;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eField 2, any given SQL Server node FQDN which will become part of the DAG.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich looks like this:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg class=\"tw-inline\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/2016/05/26/sfb-ha-sql-dag-configuration/DAG_Before.png\" srcset=\"/2016/05/26/sfb-ha-sql-dag-configuration/DAG_Before_hu17b7e1fb734a78195e779513aac511dd_77169_800x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp 800w, /2016/05/26/sfb-ha-sql-dag-configuration/DAG_Before_hu17b7e1fb734a78195e779513aac511dd_77169_1200x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp 1200w, /2016/05/26/sfb-ha-sql-dag-configuration/DAG_Before_hu17b7e1fb734a78195e779513aac511dd_77169_1600x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp 1600w\" sizes=\"auto\" alt=\"DAG before\" height=\"429\" width=\"562\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the installation was complete and my published topology was running I ran into all sorts of problems, the root of which was the SQL datasource being read-only. Shortly after I determined the errors went away for a while when I switched the active node in the SQL cluster, so \u003cem\u003esomething\u003c/em\u003e had to be wrong with those settings… \u003cstrong\u003ebut what\u003c/strong\u003e?!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-fix\" class=\"headerLink\"\u003e\r\n    \u003ca href=\"#the-fix\" class=\"header-mark\" aria-label=\"Header mark for 'The fix'\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003eThe fix\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo what’s the correct configuration? After the initial installation of SfB \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e finalizing the replication of all the databases for the SQL DAG, \u003cstrong\u003eyou need to change the SQL server FQDN back to the DAG FQDN.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eField 1 requires, SQL Server DAG FQDN;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eField 2 requires, SQL Server DAG FQDN.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"tw-inline\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/2016/05/26/sfb-ha-sql-dag-configuration/DAG_After.png\" srcset=\"/2016/05/26/sfb-ha-sql-dag-configuration/DAG_After_hu17202ef34e365d6b5c6f34fac0f7e78d_77472_800x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp 800w, /2016/05/26/sfb-ha-sql-dag-configuration/DAG_After_hu17202ef34e365d6b5c6f34fac0f7e78d_77472_1200x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp 1200w, /2016/05/26/sfb-ha-sql-dag-configuration/DAG_After_hu17202ef34e365d6b5c6f34fac0f7e78d_77472_1600x0_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp 1600w\" sizes=\"auto\" alt=\"DAG after\" height=\"429\" width=\"562\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy are there two fields for the same setting? You need to install the databases onto a single SQL node once before you can switch on the DAG settings, \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ethen remember to reconfigure the SQL store in your SfB topology with the DAG FQDN\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e. Would be nice if the Microsoft documentation was explicit on the little things like these. One final tip, whenever you see a field that requires the \u003cstrong\u003eFQDN\u003c/strong\u003e, double check you \u003cem\u003eactually used the FQDN\u003c/em\u003e before publishing your topology. Changing the FQDN on the SQL Server store after the topology has been published can be a chore…\u003c/p\u003e\n",
